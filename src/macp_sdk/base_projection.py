        Precondition — accepted history only, not enforced here: callers MUST
        feed only envelopes that a conforming runtime accepted. A subscribe
        stream satisfies this automatically (RFC-MACP-0006 §3.2 obligation 4:
        a runtime never replays rejected envelopes). Any other feed — hand-built
        fixtures, captured logs, transcripts carrying non-accepted entries — MUST
        be filtered by the caller before it reaches this method, the way
        ``tests/conformance/test_conformance_projections.py:153`` filters out
        non-``accept`` fixture entries. This method has no way to verify that
        precondition, and derived state is **undefined** without it.

        Idempotency: applying an envelope whose ``message_id`` has already been
        seen by this projection is a total no-op — it is not appended to
        ``transcript`` and is not dispatched to mode handling. This makes
        redelivery (e.g. a stream resubscribe replaying accepted history from
        the start) safe to re-apply without corrupting derived state. An empty
        ``message_id`` (the proto3 default for hand-built envelopes) is never
        deduplicated — every such envelope is applied. See the code comment on
        the dedup gate below for the precise normative basis.

        Honest limitation: this dedups **redelivery of the same envelope**, not
        every way a feed can carry a non-conforming message. A *genuine*
        duplicate -- e.g. a second, distinct ``Vote`` from a sender who already
        voted on the same proposal, carrying its own new ``message_id`` -- is
        not caught here: it passes this method's dedup gate, is appended to
        ``transcript``, and is dispatched to mode handling like any other
        envelope. Discarding it and recording the observation is the mode
        projection's job, not this base method's -- see
        ``DecisionProjection``'s Vote branch and ``QuorumProjection._set_ballot``,
        which apply first-wins and append a ``ProjectionAnomaly`` (``anomalies``,
        ``has_anomalies``) rather than silently overwriting. A rejected vote
        from a sender who never votes again still corrupts derived state with
        nothing here to detect it -- this method has no visibility into
        cardinality rules, which are mode-specific. No mechanism in this
        method closes that narrower gap; do not imply one exists.

        Determinism holds in both directions: replaying ``transcript`` through a
        fresh projection reproduces the same state, whether or not duplicates or
        redeliveries were present in the original feed.

        Acceptance is not a wire property: nothing on the envelope itself marks
        it as "accepted" — it is accepted only by virtue of appearing in
        accepted history at all, per the precondition above. If a caller sees a
        surprising result, correlate the offending envelope's ``message_id``
        against their own acceptance metadata (what they actually received back
        from the runtime) to determine whether the surprise came from a
        non-conforming source or from an unfiltered feed, rather than assuming
        this method mis-processed it.

        Not thread-safe: the ``message_id`` dedup check-then-add below is not
        atomic across threads, and this class holds no lock. A single
        projection instance must not be fed concurrently from multiple threads.

        On failure: if applying the envelope raises, this method removes the
        envelope from ``transcript`` and releases its ``message_id`` from the
        dedup set before the exception propagates, so the caller may retry
        the identical envelope and it will be applied rather than silently
        swallowed as a redelivery. This rollback covers only ``transcript``
        and the dedup set — subclass-derived state (e.g. ``self.phase``, or
        any subclass collection) is not rolled back.

        **Implementations MUST do all fallible work before any mutation**
        ("raise-before-mutate"). Parse the payload (``ParseFromString``, the
        one operation that realistically raises here), validate it, and
        decide what to do — *then* assign ``self.phase`` or touch any
        subclass collection. Never mutate and then run something that can
        raise.

        This is a real contract, not style advice, and it is what makes
        ``apply_envelope``'s rollback sufficient. That rollback restores
        ``transcript`` and the ``message_id`` dedup set only — it cannot
        restore subclass state, because the base class has no way to know
        what a subclass mutated (a slotted subclass has no ``__dict__`` to
        snapshot, and deep-copying every projection per envelope would be a
        real per-message cost). An implementation that mutates and then
        raises therefore leaves *its own* state half-applied while
        ``apply_envelope`` reports a clean rollback and invites the caller
        to retry — a partial apply the base class cannot detect or undo.

        Every implementation in this SDK honors this today (see the
        per-branch parse-then-mutate ordering in ``projections.py``,
        ``quorum.py``, ``task.py``, ``handoff.py``, and ``proposal.py``).
        Two branches come close to the line: ``handoff.py``'s
        ``HandoffAccept`` writes the record before reading
        ``getattr(p, "implicit", False)``, and ``proposal.py``'s ``Reject``
        appends before reading ``p.terminal`` and ``self.proposals.get(...)``.
        Both are safe only because a defaulted ``getattr``, a protobuf field
        read, and ``dict.get`` cannot raise — not because the ordering there
        is exemplary.

        ``tests/unit/test_projection_rollback_invariant.py`` pins the
        ordering by feeding each branch a payload that cannot parse and
        asserting no derived state moved. Note what that does *not* reach: a
        branch that mutates and then does something else fallible (a raising
        property, an ``int()``, a strict lookup) is not caught, because a
        malformed payload never gets that far. The contract is broader than
        the test — hence stating it here.
