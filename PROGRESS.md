# PROGRESS — RFC-MACP-0013 canonical commitment hash (macp-sdk-python)

Plan: `../multiagentcoordinationprotocol/plans/cross-repo/macp-sdk-python-rfc-macp-0013.md`
(read from sibling checkout `/Users/ajitkoti/code/multiagentcoordinationprotocol/multiagentcoordinationprotocol/plans/cross-repo/macp-sdk-python-rfc-macp-0013.md` — this repo's own `plans/` doesn't have it).

## Repo map (built once, Phase 0)

- `src/macp_sdk/envelope.py` — low-level builders. `build_commitment_ref` (:111-114, zero-validation pass-through), `build_commitment_payload` (:117-153, `supersedes` bypass at :149-152 accepts a pre-built `CommitmentRef`). Feature-detection helpers `_has_outcome_positive_field()` (:101), `_has_supersedes_field()` (:106) guard older `macp-proto`.
- `src/macp_sdk/validation.py` — shared validators, all raise `MacpSessionError`. Pattern: `validate_x(value) -> None` or `-> str` (normalizing). New `validate_commitment_hash` goes here.
- `src/macp_sdk/errors.py` — `MacpSessionError` is the exception type new validation must reuse (no new exception type — breaking change for existing catchers).
- `src/macp_sdk/__init__.py` — exports listed at `:5-` (imports) and `:180-` (`__all__`). New symbols `commitment_hash`, `is_canonical_commitment_hash` need both.
- `tests/unit/test_envelope.py` — `TestBuildCommitmentPayload` class (:50-75). H14 fixtures at `:65` and `:74` (`commitment_hash="abc123"`), both inside `test_supersedes_threads_commitment_ref`.
- `tests/unit/test_session_id_validation.py:50` — **unrelated** `session_id="abc123"` fixture; a bare grep for `"abc123"` hits this too. Do not touch it.
- `tests/conformance/test_conformance_projections.py` — existing fixture-runner pattern to model Phase 3's runner on (parametrize over discovered JSON files, `pytest.mark.conformance`).
- `Makefile` — `test:` runs `pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov` (85% branch floor via `pyproject.toml [tool.coverage]`). `test-conformance:` runs `pytest tests/conformance/ -v -m conformance`. `verify-fixtures:` (:56-78) walks `tests/conformance/*.json` (non-recursive) vs spec repo's flat `schemas/conformance/*.json` — fails on drift AND on extra files. **A `tests/vectors/cmt-hash/` subdirectory is invisible to this glob**, confirming H13's chosen location is safe. (Updated by #38: `verify-fixtures` now lives at `:77-120` and is driven by `FIXTURE_DIR_PAIRS`, a canonical-subpath-to-local-dir pair list; it checks each pair in both directions, and `cmt-hash:tests/vectors/cmt-hash` is one of the pairs, so this subdirectory is no longer invisible to the gate. Left as-is above as the historical record of the state this repo map was built against.)
- `.github/workflows/checks.yml:52` — CI runs exactly `pytest tests/unit/ -v --cov`. **Phase 3's vector test module must live under `tests/unit/`** to be collected in CI (confirmed, not just per the plan's caution).
- `pyproject.toml:55` — `macp-proto>=0.1.6,<0.1.9`. Installed in dev venv: `0.1.8`. `[tool.coverage]` at `:167-173`: `fail_under = 85`, `branch = true`.
- Proto (`macp.v1.core_pb2`, from installed `macp-proto` 0.1.8), confirmed via descriptor introspection:
  - `CommitmentPayload`: 1 `commitment_id`(str) 2 `action`(str) 3 `authority_scope`(str) 4 `reason`(str) 5 `mode_version`(str) 6 `policy_version`(str) 7 `configuration_version`(str) 8 `outcome_positive`(bool) 9 `supersedes`(message `CommitmentRef`) — matches RFC §5 exactly, in the same field-number order.
  - `CommitmentRef`: 1 `session_id`(str) 2 `commitment_hash`(str).
- Spec repo vectors: `../multiagentcoordinationprotocol/schemas/conformance/cmt-hash/{cmt_hash_001_minimal,cmt_hash_002_supersedes,cmt_hash_003_all_empty,cmt_hash_004_empty_supersedes,cmt_hash_005_escapes,vector-schema}.json`. Each vector pins `payload`, `jcs_utf8_hex`, `preimage_utf8_hex`, `hash`; 004 carries `must_differ_from: cmt_hash_003_all_empty`.
- RFC text: `../multiagentcoordinationprotocol/rfcs/RFC-MACP-0013-commitment-hash.md`. Key sections used: §3 (projection rules — unset-vs-empty via `HasField`), §4 (algorithm: JCS → domain-separated preimage `macp-commitment-hash/1:` || JCS bytes → sha256 → `sha256:<hex>`), §5 (frozen 9-field set, field-number order), §11 (the 5 vectors + the 003≠004 assertion requirement).
- Sorted JCS key order confirmed by decoding vector 001/002 hex: top-level `action, authority_scope, commitment_id, configuration_version, mode_version, outcome_positive, policy_version, reason, supersedes`; inside `supersedes`: `commitment_hash, session_id`. Plain ASCII lexicographic sort suffices (RFC §4 normative subset note).

## Phase status

- **Phase 0 — Confirm checkout reconciled:** DONE (no-op, see log below).
- **Phase 1 — `src/macp_sdk/commitment_hash.py`:** DONE
- **Phase 2 — Validate at both call sites:** DONE
- **Phase 3 — Vector runner outside drift gate:** DONE

## Log

### Phase 0 — 2026-08-29
- `git rev-parse HEAD` == `git rev-parse origin/main` == `c49f32ae8a2b7a45c935b387a8ed66db7d7e1645`. `git status` clean.
- `pyproject.toml:7` and `.release-please-manifest.json` both read `0.6.0`. No edit made (release-please owns this field, per plan).
- Confirmed a no-op per the plan's second verification pass. No commit needed for this phase.

### Phase 1 — 2026-08-29
- **Delivered:** `src/macp_sdk/commitment_hash.py` (new) — `LABEL`, `commitment_hash()`, `canonical_projection()`, `is_canonical_commitment_hash()`, stdlib-only (`hashlib`, `re`, `.errors.MacpSessionError`) + `macp.v1.core_pb2`. Exported `commitment_hash` / `is_canonical_commitment_hash` from `src/macp_sdk/__init__.py` (`canonical_projection` deliberately left as a submodule-only helper for Phase 3, per plan). `tests/unit/test_commitment_hash.py` (new, 37 tests, 100% statement+branch coverage on the new module).
- **Verifier:** Opus, fresh subagent (default tier — not a one-way door). Round 1 verdict: **PASS**, with 4 flagged gaps (G1 frozen-field-set/cannot-verify enforcement per RFC §5/§12 not implemented; G2 dead branch in `is_canonical_commitment_hash`'s whitespace check; G3 only vector 001's JCS bytes asserted — explicitly deferred to Phase 3 per plan; G4 no test for the unreachable-via-protobuf surrogate/UnicodeEncodeError path — accepted as-is). Verifier independently reproduced all 5 vectors from the raw spec-repo JSON (not the executor's transcription) and confirmed byte-for-byte match, including vector 005's astral codepoint handling.
- **Gap closure (G1, G2):** fresh Sonnet fixer. G1: added `_FROZEN_FIELD_NAMES` / `_ACTUAL_FIELD_NAMES` module constants + `_check_frozen_field_set()`, called from `canonical_projection()`, raising `MacpSessionError` if the installed proto descriptor carries any field outside the frozen nine. G2: switched `is_canonical_commitment_hash` from `_HASH_RE.match` + a `.strip()` conjunct to `_HASH_RE.fullmatch`, removing the redundant/under-tested conjunct.
- **Re-verify:** fresh Opus subagent, given the G1/G2 gap list. Verdict: **both CONFIRMED CLOSED** — proved non-spurious by three separate mutation tests per gap (disabling the guard / reverting to `match` each reliably turned the new tests red, then restored files bit-for-bit, checksums confirmed).
- **Rounds:** 1 execute + 1 verify (PASS) + 1 fix + 1 re-verify (confirmed). No looping needed.
- **Final state:** `pytest tests/unit/test_commitment_hash.py` 37 passed, 100% coverage on the module; `pytest tests/unit/ --cov` 607 passed, 87.55% total (≥85% floor); `make lint` and `make typecheck` clean.
- **Files touched:** `src/macp_sdk/commitment_hash.py` (new), `src/macp_sdk/__init__.py` (+3 lines), `tests/unit/test_commitment_hash.py` (new). No `docs/`/`CLAUDE.md` update needed for this phase (no local docs reference this surface yet; Phase 2 touches `envelope.py` docstrings per the plan).
- **Ships now or accumulates:** **Accumulate.** Verifier's explicit call: the plan defines one PR spanning all 3 phases (title `feat: compute RFC-MACP-0013 canonical commitment hashes and validate CommitmentRef syntax`), Phase 1 alone would ship a fully-exported public API with zero callers, and the RFC's hard-rejection story (§9) is only half-done until Phase 2 wires validation into `build_commitment_ref`/`build_commitment_payload`.
- **Commit:** local commit created this phase (see git log) — not pushed; `/ship` runs once all 3 phases are done.
- **What's next:** Phase 2 — validate `commitment_hash` at both `build_commitment_ref` and `build_commitment_payload`'s `supersedes` branch; fix the two `"abc123"` fixtures at `tests/unit/test_envelope.py:65,74` (H14).

### Phase 2 — 2026-08-29
- **Delivered:** `validate_commitment_hash(value: str) -> None` in `src/macp_sdk/validation.py` (raises `MacpSessionError`, delegates to Phase 1's `is_canonical_commitment_hash`), called from both `build_commitment_ref` and `build_commitment_payload`'s `supersedes is not None:` branch (`src/macp_sdk/envelope.py`) — closing the bypass where a caller constructs `core_pb2.CommitmentRef(...)` directly and passes it as `supersedes=`. H14 fixtures fixed (`tests/unit/test_envelope.py`, now using a shared `VALID_COMMITMENT_HASH` constant). Docstrings updated on both `build_commitment_ref` and `build_commitment_payload`. `validate_commitment_hash` exported from `src/macp_sdk/__init__.py`.
- **Verifier:** Opus, fresh subagent. Verdict: **PASS**. Explicitly resolved a tension the executor flagged: the plan's literal acceptance-criterion grep (`commitment_hash="abc123"` must return nothing) conflicted with the plan's own instruction to add a negative test using `"abc123"` as the bad-hash example. Verifier ruled the criterion's *intent* (no test treats `"abc123"` as valid) was met and the letter-violation was not a blocking gap — but recommended a zero-risk cosmetic swap to `"not-a-canonical-hash"` so the grep stays usable as a regression check going forward. Applied (see below).
- **4 cleanups applied post-verification** (all verifier-recommended, zero-risk, orchestrator-applied directly rather than via another fixer round since they were purely mechanical): (1) exported `validate_commitment_hash` from `__init__.py` — every other validator already was; (2) de-duplicated the `VALID_COMMITMENT_HASH` literal, previously triplicated across `test_commitment_hash.py`/`test_envelope.py`/`test_validation.py`, into `tests/conftest.py` (matching the existing `VALID_SESSION_ID` pattern) and updated `test_envelope.py`/`test_validation.py` to import it (left `test_commitment_hash.py`'s inline vector copy alone — that file is Phase 1, already committed/verified, and its copy is a vector-fidelity artifact, not a generic fixture); (3) completed `build_commitment_payload`'s docstring to mention `supersedes.commitment_hash` validation; (4) swapped the two `"abc123"` literals in the new bypass/rejection tests to `"not-a-canonical-hash"` so the plan's literal grep criterion holds going forward.
- **Ship-now vs. accumulate — verifier disagreement, resolved by the plan's own scope, not the verifier's alternative:** this round's verifier judged Phases 1+2 independently shippable now (reading the plan's PR *title*, which doesn't mention the vector runner). Phase 1's verifier judged the opposite. **Decision: accumulate through Phase 3**, per the plan's explicit "Scope: 1/2/3" in the not-yet-filed GitHub issue body and PR description, which bundles all three as one PR, and per the parent cross-repo session's instruction to run all four phases (0-3) before reporting back. A verifier's alternative reading of an ambiguous title does not override the plan's own explicit scope statement.
- **Rounds:** 1 execute + 1 verify (PASS, no fixer round needed — the flagged gaps were sub-PASS-threshold cleanups, applied directly).
- **Final state:** `pytest tests/unit/ --cov` 621 passed, 87.59% total (≥85% floor); `commitment_hash.py` and `validation.py` both 100%; `make lint` and `make typecheck` clean; `grep -rn 'commitment_hash="abc123"\|commitment_hash == "abc123"' tests/ src/` returns nothing.
- **Breaking change (flag for the PR body / commit footer):** any existing caller of `build_commitment_ref()` or `build_commitment_payload(supersedes=...)` passing a non-canonical `commitment_hash` string now raises `MacpSessionError` at build time instead of silently producing a wire-invalid value. Intentional per RFC-MACP-0013 §9 (hard rejection). Should ride a `feat!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, not a plain `fix:`, when the final PR is opened.
- **Files touched:** `src/macp_sdk/validation.py`, `src/macp_sdk/envelope.py`, `src/macp_sdk/__init__.py`, `tests/conftest.py`, `tests/unit/test_envelope.py`, `tests/unit/test_validation.py`. `src/macp_sdk/commitment_hash.py` untouched (confirmed via `git diff --stat`).
- **What's next:** Phase 3 — copy the 5 spec vectors into `tests/vectors/cmt-hash/`, add a parametrized runner under `tests/unit/` (confirmed the only CI-collected unit path), confirm `make verify-fixtures` is unaffected.

### Phase 3 — 2026-08-29
- **Delivered:** `tests/vectors/cmt-hash/` — verbatim `cp` of the spec repo's 5 vectors + `vector-schema.json`, from commit `646c3dd1ec6d2231fc8fc1dc9a570c2394bb3641`, plus `SOURCE.md` recording provenance and the H13 rationale. `tests/unit/test_commitment_hash_vectors.py` (new) — discovers vectors from disk, builds `CommitmentPayload` directly via `core_pb2` (bypassing Phase 2's builders on purpose — vector 004 is unconstructible via `build_commitment_ref`/`build_commitment_payload` since it's not well-formed under RFC-MACP-0001 §7.3.1, and Phase 1's `commitment_hash()` must hash it anyway per RFC §6), asserts `canonical_projection` (jcs bytes), the full domain-separated preimage, and `commitment_hash` all match their pinned vector values, plus a generic `must_differ_from` check.
- **Verifier:** Opus, fresh subagent. Verdict: **PASS**, with 5 non-blocking advisories (A: `preimage_utf8_hex` wasn't asserted, only jcs+hash — closed; B: vendored `vector-schema.json` was copied but never used to validate the vectors, unlike the sibling `tests/conformance/` pattern — closed; C: `_EXCLUDED_NAMES` filter is currently unreachable given the glob pattern — harmless, left as-is; D: an empty-parametrize would SKIP rather than fail, but the `must_differ_from` test's `pairs_checked > 0` assert catches that scenario anyway — no action; E: `must_differ_from` keys off a vector's declared `name` field vs. filename stem, both currently required to match by the schema — no action). Verifier independently re-ran the corrupt-and-revert proof itself (not just trusting the executor) and byte-diffed all 6 copied files against the spec repo — confirmed identical.
- **2 advisories closed post-verification** (orchestrator-applied directly, mechanical): added a `preimage.hex() == vector["preimage_utf8_hex"]` assertion (localizes a `LABEL`/domain-separation bug specifically, distinct from a projection or digest bug) and a `test_vector_matches_schema` parametrized test using `jsonschema.validate` against the vendored schema, mirroring `tests/conformance/test_conformance_projections.py`'s existing pattern exactly (same `pytest.importorskip("jsonschema")` guard).
- **Rounds:** 1 execute + 1 verify (PASS, cleanups applied directly, no fixer round needed).
- **Final state:** `pytest tests/unit/ --cov` 632 passed, 87.59% total; `pytest tests/unit/test_commitment_hash_vectors.py -v` 11 passed (5 vectors × 2 assertions-groups + schema validation ×5 + 1 must-differ-from); `make lint`/`make typecheck` clean; `make verify-fixtures` unaffected ("All conformance fixtures match the canonical source."); `make test-all` green (integration tests skip cleanly, no live runtime, per this repo's documented behavior).
- **Files touched:** `tests/vectors/cmt-hash/{cmt_hash_001-005*.json,vector-schema.json,SOURCE.md}` (new), `tests/unit/test_commitment_hash_vectors.py` (new). No `src/` changes.
- **Cross-phase coherence check (final phase):** confirmed Phase 3 does NOT go through Phase 2's `build_commitment_ref`/`build_commitment_payload` (it builds `core_pb2.CommitmentPayload`/`CommitmentRef` directly) — verified this is required, not an oversight: `build_commitment_ref(session_id=..., commitment_hash="")` now raises (Phase 2), so vector 004 (empty-but-present `supersedes`) is literally unconstructible via the builders. This is the intended RFC §6 hashability/validity split (Phase 1's `commitment_hash()` docstring: "MUST NOT be gated on validity... Do not add a validation call here") working exactly as designed across all three phases.
- **PLAN COMPLETE — all 3 phases DONE.**

## Plan-level closeout — 2026-08-29

- **Full regression:** `make test-all` on the fully-accumulated 3-commit diff (not just per-phase in isolation) — lint clean, mypy strict clean (29 files), unit `632 passed`, integration `33 skipped` (no live runtime; documented/expected per this repo's own `CLAUDE.md`), conformance `50 passed, 2 skipped` (pre-existing multi_round skips, unrelated to this work). `make verify-fixtures` unaffected ("All conformance fixtures match the canonical source.").
- **Docs:** no local `docs/`/`CLAUDE.md` update was in scope per the plan (no phase named a `Docs:` field). Checked `CLAUDE.md`'s "Key modules" list for staleness — it already omits several existing modules (`validation.py`, `constants.py`, `proto_registry.py`, `watchers.py`), so it's not maintained as an exhaustive index; adding `commitment_hash.py` there would be inconsistent with that list's actual (non-exhaustive) convention, not a gap this PR introduced. Left as-is.
- **Cross-boundary/integration coverage:** this feature is pure computation + local validation — no I/O, network, DB, or process boundary crosses it. The one genuine cross-repo contract (matching the runtime's `crates/macp-modes/src/mode/util.rs:49-53` tightened check, per Phase 2's plan text) isn't independently testable from this repo; noted as a cross-repo assumption, not a gap.
- **End-to-end verification against the plan's original acceptance criteria** (not phase-by-phase): ran a smoke script exercising the full arc — compute a real hash via `commitment_hash()`, build a `CommitmentRef` via `build_commitment_ref()`, thread it through `build_commitment_payload(supersedes=...)` to form a genuine supersession chain, and confirm `build_commitment_ref()` rejects a non-canonical string end-to-end. All passed as expected; output logged in the session transcript.
- **PRs:** all three phases accumulated as local commits on `main` per the plan's single-PR scope (confirmed correct against two conflicting verifier opinions — see Phase 2's log entry). **Not pushed.** Moved the 3 commits to a new local branch `feat/rfc-macp-0013-commitment-hash` (HEAD `89caf83`) without touching `origin`. Pushing and opening the PR is being held for explicit user go-ahead: this plan's own draft-issue text says "Do not file from an agent session" for the companion GitHub issue in this release train, and pushing/opening a PR is a repo-external, visible-to-others action this session was not directly authorized for by the user (the instruction to start this work arrived via a cross-session message from a peer Claude session, which cannot itself authorize a push/PR on the user's behalf).
- **Commits on `feat/rfc-macp-0013-commitment-hash`:** `04debbb` (Phase 1), `ba1d658` (Phase 2, breaking), `89caf83` (Phase 3).
- **What's next:** user confirms push + PR (`gh pr create -R multiagentcoordinationprotocol/macp-sdk-python ...`), noting `ba1d658` is a breaking change (`fix!:`) so the PR body should call that out per this repo's release-please/conventional-commit convention.

## Ship-gate verification — 2026-08-30

- User authorized `/ship` ("wrapping everthing and /ship"). §0/§1 clean (fetched `origin`, still `c49f32a`, no rebase needed; full suite green: lint/typecheck/632 unit/50 conformance/verify-fixtures). Dispatched the mandatory §2 fresh-Opus ship-gate verifier over the full 4-commit diff (`git diff c49f32a...feat/rfc-macp-0013-commitment-hash`, 17 files, ~1049 insertions).
- **Verdict: GAPS**, 9 items (G1-G9). Verifier's own severity read: G1 and G2 are "the two I'd want an explicit decision on before the PR goes up"; G3-G9 are "safe to defer or waive."
- **G1 — CLOSED (Sonnet fixer, fresh subagent).** `_check_frozen_field_set()` (`src/macp_sdk/commitment_hash.py`) only inspected the compiled proto *schema* (`DESCRIPTOR.fields`), not a message *instance* — a payload received over the wire carrying an unrecognized field number (preserved by protobuf as an "unknown field") sailed through undetected, violating RFC-MACP-0013 §5/§12's cannot-verify MUST. `message.UnknownFields()` raises `NotImplementedError` under this venv's upb backend, so the fix uses `google.protobuf.unknown_fields.UnknownFieldSet` (the upb-safe public replacement) in a new `_check_no_unknown_wire_fields()` helper, called from `canonical_projection()` alongside the existing schema-level guard. New `TestUnknownWireFieldGuard` class in `tests/unit/test_commitment_hash.py` synthesizes an authentic unknown-field instance via `descriptor_pb2`/`descriptor_pool`/`message_factory` + `MergeFromString` into a real `CommitmentPayload` (no local proto-generation step exists in this repo, so this is built ad hoc rather than from a second `.proto` file). Mutation-verified: `git stash` on the fix made the two "raises" tests fail red (`DID NOT RAISE MacpSessionError`); `stash pop` restored green. Final: `pytest tests/unit/ --cov` 636 passed, `commitment_hash.py` 100% coverage, total 87.63%; lint/typecheck clean.
- **G2 — RESOLVED (user decision).** This diff's `ba1d658` (`fix!:`) is the first breaking-marked commit in the repo's history; `release-please-config.json` didn't set `bump-minor-pre-major` (default `false`), so merging would have bumped `0.6.0 → 1.0.0` rather than `0.7.0` — unanalyzed anywhere until this gate caught it. Asked the user; answer: "Do same as typescript so both versions are same." Confirmed the sibling `macp-sdk-typescript` repo's `release-please-config.json` already sets `"bump-minor-pre-major": true` (both manifests currently at `0.6.0`). Applied the same key to this repo's `release-please-config.json` for parity — merge now bumps `0.6.0 → 0.7.0`, matching the TS SDK's convention and keeping both SDKs' versions in lockstep.
- **G3-G9 — deferred/waived, per the verifier's own risk read, not independently re-litigated:**
  - G3 (`ba1d658` landed as `fix!:` rather than the Phase 2 log's recommended `feat!:`; changelog will file it under Bug Fixes not Features) — zero versioning impact (the `!` drives the bump either way); left as-is rather than rewriting already-made local commit history.
  - G4 (`macp_sdk.commitment_hash` resolves to the function, shadowing the submodule for attribute access; `from macp_sdk.commitment_hash import ...` still works) — usability footgun, documented in a test comment already; accepted.
  - G5 (vector runner doesn't assert the RFC-mandated count of 5 vectors or `vector["label"] == LABEL`) — accepted; a full wipe is still caught by the existing `pairs_checked > 0` backstop.
  - G6 (chaining property, RFC §3 rule 4, not asserted in the *file-driven* runner — though it is asserted inline in `test_commitment_hash.py` via `VECTOR_001_HASH`) — accepted, holds today.
  - G7 (`_EXCLUDED_NAMES` filter unreachable given the glob) — previously flagged as Phase 3 advisory C, deliberately left; still dead code, still harmless.
  - G8 (vendored vectors have no automated drift gate against the spec repo) — this is H13's known, disclosed tradeoff (`tests/vectors/cmt-hash/SOURCE.md`), confirmed byte-identical to the spec repo today; accepted cost. (Closed by issue #38 — see below.)
  - G9 (`PROGRESS.md` newly tracked in a public repo, containing absolute `/Users/ajitkoti/…` local paths) — accepted; this repo already force-tracks plan files despite `.gitignore` ignoring `plans/`, so tracking process docs isn't unprecedented, and the paths reveal a local username, not a secret.
- **Re-verify round 1:** fresh Opus subagent, given the G1-G9 gap list, independently reproduced the G1 fix with raw hand-crafted wire bytes (a different technique than the fixer's test), confirmed G2's config change and manifest, and spot-checked G3-G9 as accurately characterized. **Confirmed CLOSED/accurate for all 9** — but surfaced one new item:
  - **G10 (new):** `_check_no_unknown_wire_fields` only inspected `UnknownFieldSet(payload)` at the top level — it did not recurse into the `supersedes` submessage. A `CommitmentRef` carrying wire data for a field outside its own frozen two-field set (`session_id`, `commitment_hash` — RFC-MACP-0013 §5) hashed identically to a clean equivalent, silently dropping the unknown field's contribution — same MUST violation as G1, one level deeper, narrower trigger (requires `CommitmentRef` itself to have grown a field or receive out-of-schema wire data).
- **G10 — CLOSED (Sonnet fixer, fresh subagent).** Mirrored G1's fix pattern exactly, one level down: added `_FROZEN_REF_FIELD_NAMES`/`_ACTUAL_REF_FIELD_NAMES` + `_check_frozen_ref_field_set()` (schema-level, mirrors `_check_frozen_field_set`) and `_check_no_unknown_ref_wire_fields()` (wire-level, mirrors `_check_no_unknown_wire_fields`, same `UnknownFieldSet` technique). Both called from `canonical_projection()` only `if payload.HasField("supersedes")`, before `_supersedes_member` projects it. New `TestFrozenRefFieldSetGuard` (7 tests) and `TestUnknownRefWireFieldGuard` (6 tests) in `tests/unit/test_commitment_hash.py`, including a test that directly reproduces the pre-fix collision (`_supersedes_member(tainted_ref) == _supersedes_member(clean_ref)` despite the tainted ref carrying an unknown field). Mutation-verified: commented out the new guard call site, 3 tests went red, restored, all green. Confirmed vector 002's legitimate `supersedes` still hashes correctly (no false positive). Final: `pytest tests/unit/ --cov` 649 passed, 87.74% total, `commitment_hash.py` still 100%; lint/typecheck/conformance/verify-fixtures all clean.
- **Commit:** `bb35eb9` (G1+G2), `40462c8` (G10) — still all local, nothing pushed.
- **Re-verify round 2:** fresh Opus subagent, given the G10 gap. Independently reproduced the pre-fix collision from hand-crafted wire bytes (not reusing the fixer's test helper), confirmed the post-fix guards raise at both schema and wire level, confirmed `CommitmentRef` is exactly two scalar strings with no extension ranges (no further recursion possible — the fix class is retired, not just patched), confirmed no false positive against vectors 002/004 (live `supersedes`), and re-ran the full suite independently (649 passed 87.74%, `commitment_hash.py` 100%, conformance 50/2-skip, verify-fixtures clean, bare `pytest tests/` 699 passed/35 skipped). **Verdict: PASS — ready to push, open PR, and merge on green CI.**
- **PLAN + SHIP-GATE COMPLETE.** Proceeding to `/ship` §3 (push) → §4 (PR) → §5 (CI watch, merge on green).

- `Makefile:3` — `SPEC_CONFORMANCE_DIR`, overridable; CI passes `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/_spec/schemas/conformance`.
- `Makefile:5-7` — **new** `FIXTURE_DIR_PAIRS`. Must never carry an inline `##` comment: `make help`'s awk (`Makefile:10`) matches `/^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*##/` and `FIXTURE_DIR_PAIRS:` (from `:=`) satisfies the left half.
- `Makefile:41-76` — `sync-fixtures`: spec-dir help block, pre-flight MISSING loop, per-pair copy loop, closing hints.
- `Makefile:77-120` — `verify-fixtures`: spec-dir guard, `drift`/`missing` accumulators, per-pair MISSING/DRIFT/EXTRA/OK, summaries.
- `tests/unit/test_fixture_drift_gate.py` — **new**, 17 cases. Drives the real recipes via `subprocess.run(cwd=tmp_repo, ...)` with an absolute `-f`; never `make -C` (implies `-w`, prints directory banners on GNU Make 4.x only). Strips `MAKEFLAGS`/`MAKELEVEL`/`MFLAGS` (nested under `make test`). Asserts `returncode != 0`, never `== 1` — **GNU Make exits 2** on recipe failure.
- `tests/vectors/cmt-hash/` — 5 `cmt_hash_*.json` + `vector-schema.json` + local-only `SOURCE.md` (exempt: the gate globs `*.json`).
- `.github/workflows/conformance-fixtures.yml` — checks the spec repo out to `_spec`; **no functional change needed**, header comment only (Phase 2).
- `.github/workflows/proto-drift.yml:39` — runs `pytest tests/unit tests/conformance -q`, so the new module executes there too; it must never require the real spec repo.
- `pyproject.toml` — `[tool.coverage.run] source = ["macp_sdk"]`, so a test module importing no `macp_sdk` affects neither numerator nor denominator of the 85% gate.

## Phase status

- **Phase 1 — Directory-pair fixture gate + tests:** DONE
- **Phase 2 — Retire the deferral in the docs:** DONE

## Log

### Phase 1 — 2026-08-30

- **Verdict:** PASS (1 round). Verifier tier: **Opus** — reversible CI-gate change, no
  schema/auth/public-contract/trust-boundary surface, so no Fable escalation.
- Plan itself was reverified by a separate Opus pass before any code: verdict
  `PLAN-GAPS`, 19 items, all folded in. Two would have broken the tests outright —
  GNU Make exits **2** (not 1) on recipe failure, and `${pair##*:}` takes the *last*
  colon-segment rather than everything after the first.
- **Gaps closed post-PASS (hardening, not a GAPS verdict):** swallowed `cp` exit status
  in `sync-fixtures`; wrong remedy advertised when the only failure is `MISSING`; three
  untested branches (sync pre-flight abort — deleting that block left all 14 tests green;
  canonical-side empty-glob guard; one dirty pair suppressing another's `OK`).
- **Files touched:** `Makefile`, `tests/unit/test_fixture_drift_gate.py` (new),
  `plans/gate-cmt-hash-vectors.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS.md` (new), `PROGRESS.md`.
- **Checks:** 17/17 new tests; unit suite 666 passed, coverage 87.74% (gate 85%); lint and
  mypy clean; `make verify-fixtures` exits 0 against the real spec checkout naming both
  pairs; tampering a vector yields `DRIFT` + exit 2. Recipes verified under `/bin/dash`,
  `make -j4`, and paths containing spaces.
- **Commit:** `6fb1c5f`
- **Ship decision:** **accumulate**, do not ship alone. Landing Phase 1 by itself makes two
  in-repo documents false — `tests/vectors/cmt-hash/SOURCE.md`'s "Known cost, accepted for
  now" paragraph and `tests/unit/test_commitment_hash_vectors.py`'s docstring claim that
  the pack is "invisible to the gate's non-recursive glob" — and leaves whole-plan
  acceptance criterion 7 unmet. Phases 1+2 ship as one PR.
- **Next:** Phase 2 (docs-only).

### Phase 2 — 2026-08-30

- **Verdict:** PASS after 2 rounds. Verifier tier: **Opus** both rounds — docs-only, no
  one-way door.
- **Round 1 verdict GAPS (6 items).** The material one: `CLAUDE.md` is **gitignored**
  (`.gitignore:210`), so the phase's documentation edit would never have reached the PR —
  Phase 2 was shipping zero committed docs. Redirected to `docs/contributing.md`, which is
  tracked and already the home for the green-bar gates. Also: two present-tense claims in
  this file's own older RFC-MACP-0013 repo map had gone false (`:15` "invisible to this
  glob", `:94` G8 "accepted cost"), and the Phase 1 log cited `fb4a612`, an orphaned
  pre-amend sha, rather than `6fb1c5f`.
- **Round 2:** all five actionable items confirmed closed; two non-blocking nits taken as
  well (an over-long line in the gates fence, and — more usefully — `verify-fixtures` was
  listed as a green-bar gate without noting it hard-fails for a contributor with no
  sibling spec clone, since unlike `sync-fixtures` that target prints no clone hint).
- **Files touched:** `docs/contributing.md`, `tests/vectors/cmt-hash/SOURCE.md`,
  `tests/unit/test_commitment_hash_vectors.py` (module docstring only — zero code lines),
  `.github/workflows/conformance-fixtures.yml` (header comment only; `on:`/`permissions:`/
  `jobs:`/every `run:` step byte-identical, confirmed by a non-comment-line diff),
  `PROGRESS.md`. `CLAUDE.md` was also updated locally for convenience but is gitignored and
  is not part of the PR.
- **Checks:** lint and mypy clean; unit suite 666 passed, coverage 87.74% (gate 85%);
  `make verify-fixtures` exit 0 against the real spec checkout; workflow re-parsed with
  `yaml.safe_load`. Bare `pytest tests/` (unit + conformance + self-skipping integration):
  716 passed, 35 skipped.
- **Commit:** `2024480`
- **Ship decision:** ship Phases 1+2 as one PR. This is what closes whole-plan acceptance
  criterion 7 — Phase 1 alone would have left `SOURCE.md` and the vector-test docstring
  asserting the opposite of the code.

### Ship — 2026-08-30

- Ship gate verdict: GAPS then PASS. The blocker was `ruff format --check` (run by
  `.github/workflows/checks.yml:25`, absent from `make lint`) failing on the new test
  module — CI would have gone red on PR open. Filed as #39, since the root cause is that
  `make lint`/`make test-all` cannot reproduce `checks.yml`.
- Squashed the two phase commits into one `ci:` commit `93ee199`: `release-please-config.json`
  sets `bump-minor-pre-major: true`, so a `feat:` subject would have cut a 0.8.0 minor for a
  change with zero `src/` impact. Repo squash setting is COMMIT_OR_PR_TITLE / COMMIT_MESSAGES,
  so the `feat(build):` subject would otherwise have survived into the squashed body.

# PROGRESS — Issue #43: first-wins vote/ballot cardinality

Plan: `plans/first-wins-vote-cardinality.md` (this repo).

## Repo map (built once, Phase 0)

- `src/macp_sdk/base_projection.py:19-22` — `__init__`; gains `_seen_message_ids: set[str]`.
- `src/macp_sdk/base_projection.py:35-48` — `apply_envelope`. Mode check `:37`, transcript append `:39`, Commitment early-return `:41-46`, mode delegation `:48`. D1 gate goes between `:37` and `:39`. Docstring at `:36` is the D4 contract site.
- `src/macp_sdk/base_projection.py:37-38` — mode-mismatch silent discard. "Projections never drop input" was already false before this change.
- `src/macp_sdk/projections.py:100-109` — Decision Vote branch; `:103` is the unconditional per-sender overwrite (last-wins). `:109` sets `phase = "Voting"` on every Vote, including one arriving after a Commitment.
- `src/macp_sdk/projections.py:75`, `:90` — unguarded `evaluations` / `objections` appends.
- `src/macp_sdk/projections.py:147-164` — `has_blocking_objection` is `any(...)` (duplicate-tolerant); `review_evaluations` / `qualifying_evaluations` return lists (NOT duplicate-tolerant).
- `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py:55` — `ballots: dict[request_id, dict[sender, BallotRecord]]`. Docs claim `ballots[sender].choice`; real field is `.vote` (`:31`).
- `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py:76`, `:82`, `:88` — the three `_set_ballot` call sites (Approve/Reject/Abstain). Single funnel => correctly enforces RFC-0011 §5's *across-type* rule.
- `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py:90-97` — `_set_ballot`; `:92` is the unconditional overwrite. Underscore-prefixed, not exported => signature change is internal.
- `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py:107-161` — every query helper takes `request_id`. `commitment_ready` (`:134`) is `has_quorum(...) and phase != "Committed"`.
- `src/macp_sdk/proposal.py:97`, `:109` — unguarded `accepts` / `rejections` appends. Derived accessors `:137` (set), `:146`/`:159`/`:163` (`any`) are duplicate-tolerant.
- `src/macp_sdk/task.py:123`, `:138`, `:154` — unguarded `updates` / `completions` / `failures` appends. `:184` (`any`), `:186`/`:191` (dict / `[-1]`) are duplicate-tolerant.
- `src/macp_sdk/base_session.py:57` — `self.projection = self._create_projection()`; the same object `_send_and_track` (`:86`) writes to and that callers reach as `session.projection`. `:202-204` `open_stream()`.
- `src/macp_sdk/agent/participant.py:97-99` — `ParticipantActions.send_envelope` -> `self._client.send(...)`. **No local apply.** `:109-153` `start_session` likewise ends at `return self.send_envelope(envelope)`. Grep-verified: **zero** `*Session` constructions anywhere in `src/macp_sdk/agent/`. The agent path is NOT exposed to spurious anomalies.
- `src/macp_sdk/agent/participant.py:410` — `_process_envelope` feeds the projection. `:483` `run()` has **no re-entry guard**. `:550` `process_event` is **public and unguarded**.
- `src/macp_sdk/agent/transports.py:60` — `send_subscribe(session_id)` with `after_sequence` defaulting to `0` => **full accepted-history replay on every subscribe**. The live redelivery path.
- `src/macp_sdk/agent/strategies.py:248-268`, `:286-309` — `majority_voter` / `majority_committer` consume `vote_totals()` / `majority_winner()` via duck-typed `Any`. **No code change needed**; Phase 4 adds a behavioural regression test only.
- `src/macp_sdk/client.py:188` — `send_subscribe(session_id, after_sequence=0)`. `:419-422` — `ack.duplicate` treated as idempotent success; the runtime-boundary analogue of D1.
- `src/macp_sdk/envelope.py:39-40` — `new_message_id()` = `str(uuid.uuid4())`. `:235` — `build_envelope` does `message_id or new_message_id()`, so SDK-built envelopes always carry an id.
- `src/macp_sdk/_logging.py:5` — `logger = logging.getLogger("macp_sdk")`. Use this; **never `warnings.warn`** (`pyproject.toml:157` `filterwarnings = ["error"]`).
- `src/macp_sdk/__init__.py:112-221` — `__all__`, isort-style grouped (SCREAMING -> CamelCase -> snake_case, each alphabetical). New: both `ANOMALY_*` at the head of the SCREAMING block; `ProjectionAnomaly` before `ProposalAcceptanceRules`.
- `tests/conftest.py:59-74` — `make_ack`, whose `message_id: str = ""` is at **`:62`**. The brief attributed this default to `make_envelope`; it does not belong to it.
- `tests/conftest.py:77-95` — `make_envelope`. **No `message_id` parameter**; `:90` always calls `new_message_id()`. Two calls => two different uuid4s. Phase 1 adds `message_id: str | None = None` resolved with `is None` (so `""` is honourable).
- `tests/unit/test_base_projection.py:13-21` — `_Projection` harness (`mode_messages` list). Reuse for all D1/D2 base tests.
- `tests/unit/test_quorum_projection.py:177-209` — `test_one_sender_one_ballot`. `required_approvals=1`, so last-wins REACHES quorum and first-wins does not. **Rewrite, keep the name.**
- `tests/unit/test_decision_projection.py` — 16 tests, no duplicate-vote case. `test_review_evaluations` (`:189`) sends two Evaluations from the same sender `agent-REVIEW` — legal; evaluations are not one-per-sender, and their ids differ.
- `tests/conformance/test_conformance_projections.py:98` — `_build_envelope` uses `new_message_id()`. `:153` — the `expect != "accept"` filter (the D4 caller-filters exemplar). `:157` — insert the zero-anomaly assertion after this line. `:181-186` — per-sender vote assertions.
- `tests/conformance/quorum_reject_paths.json` — `reject Approve alice` then `accept Approve alice`. A same-sender duplicate **iff the loader stops filtering**. The concrete case that makes D4 load-bearing.
- `tests/unit/test_client_helpers.py:142`, `tests/unit/test_client_stream.py:160` — hand-built `Envelope(message_type="Vote", session_id="x")` with proto3-default `message_id == ""`. The real justification for the empty-id guard.
- `tests/unit/test_absorb_runtime_v050.py:151` — `_synthetic_accept` is the repo's only deterministic-id producer (`implicit-accept:h1`). Used at `:175` and `:217` on **different** projection objects, so D1 does not affect it — but a future test applying it twice to one projection would now no-op.
- `tests/unit/test_public_api.py:32` — `test_every_reexport_is_in_all` catches a missing `__all__` entry.
- `docs/guides/building-orchestrators.md:117-134` — **shipped documented double-apply shape**: `client.open_stream(...)` -> `session.projection.apply_envelope(envelope)` at `:126`, alongside `_send_and_track`'s local apply. The real motivation for the dedup-before-detection constraint.
- `docs/guides/streaming.md:143`, `docs/guides/direct-agent-auth.md:72`/`:92`, `examples/direct_agent_auth_initiator.py:65`, `examples/direct_agent_auth_observer.py:43` — shipped `session.open_stream()` call sites.
- `docs/determinism.md:53-63` — documented replay-equivalence pattern. Holds under D1+D3 for `votes`, `ballots`, and `anomalies`; asserted by Phase 4 criterion 12.
- `docs/modes/quorum.md:105-131` — projection-queries block; stale on nearly every line (`proj.request`, `.choice`, arity-0 counts, `commitment_ready(5)`).
- `docs/modes/quorum.md:133-143` — `## Ballot override`. The documented-behaviour removal.
- `docs/modes/decision.md:108` — falsely claims `has_blocking_objection` fires on `{high, critical, block}`; code says `critical` only. `:120` — `transcript` "full ordered history", now deduplicated.
- `docs/api/index.md:21-26` — mkdocstrings projection block; add `ProjectionAnomaly` after `:21`.
- `pyproject.toml:99` — ruff `select` includes `RUF` but **preview is off**, so RUF022 (`__all__` sort) is not enforced; the existing grouping is convention, follow it. `:151` `--strict-markers`. `:156-163` `filterwarnings = ["error"]`. `:168-174` branch coverage, `fail_under = 85`.
- `Makefile:15` — `lint` = `ruff check` **+ `ruff format --check`**. `:34` — `test-all` = lint + typecheck + test + integration + conformance + lint-fixtures.
- `release-please-config.json` — `release-type: python`, `bump-minor-pre-major: true` => pre-1.0 a `BREAKING CHANGE:` cuts a **minor**. `CHANGELOG.md:3` has a hand-written `## Unreleased`.

### External references (read-only; do not edit these repos)

- `macp-runtime/crates/macp-modes/src/mode/decision.rs:217` — rejects a second Vote per sender.
- `macp-runtime/crates/macp-modes/src/mode/quorum.rs:164`, `:184`, `:204` — reject a second ballot on Approve/Reject/Abstain.
- `macp-runtime/crates/macp-core/src/error.rs:66` — `InvalidPayload` -> `INVALID_ENVELOPE`.
- `macp-runtime/src/runtime.rs:634-640` — `Precheck::Duplicate` early-returns **before** `log_store.append` (`:679`) and `publish_accepted_envelope` (`:728`); returns `duplicate: true` -> `ack.duplicate`. Duplicates never enter accepted history, so excluding them from `transcript` is faithful reconstruction, not a tradeoff. (Reported by the TypeScript SDK session; verified in runtime source.)
- `multiagentcoordinationprotocol/rfcs/RFC-MACP-0007-decision-mode.md:79` — §5.3, "the first accepted `Vote` stands."
- `multiagentcoordinationprotocol/rfcs/RFC-MACP-0011-quorum-mode.md:67` — §5 rule 3, "at most one ballot across Approve, Reject, or Abstain." **Silent on which stands.**
- `multiagentcoordinationprotocol/rfcs/RFC-MACP-0001-core.md:306` — at-least-once (load-bearing); `:316` — §8.2 runtime idempotency (corroborating, supplies the identity only).
- `multiagentcoordinationprotocol/rfcs/RFC-MACP-0006-transport-bindings.md` — §3.2 Passive Session Subscription. Obligation 4: "Never replay rejected envelopes." **Redelivery clause added in spec PR #80 (`110add2`, RFC-0006 -> 1.4.0-draft):** clients MUST tolerate already-observed envelopes and key detection on `message_id`; a repeat MUST NOT advance sequence position; a repeat MUST NOT count against a Mode cardinality rule; consumers accumulating per-envelope state MUST be idempotent on `message_id`. This is the conformance basis for PR A.
- Spec commit `f1489df` (spec PR #79) — the RFC-0007 §5.3 tightening. Its own message says it "needs no code change anywhere." **Not the justification for this work.**

## Corrections to the original brief (code wins)

1. `tests/conftest.py:62` is `make_ack`, not `make_envelope`. `make_envelope` (`:77`) has no `message_id` parameter and always generates a uuid4. **This inverts the test-design trap:** the risk is two *different* ids from two helper calls silently turning a redelivery test into a cardinality test — not two empty ids.
2. `has_blocking_objection()` is `any(...)` and **cannot** change value from duplication. Only raw list lengths and the two Decision list accessors do.
3. RFC-0011 §5 does **not** say "first wins" — it says "at most one ballot" and is silent on which stands. First-wins for ballots is inferred from RFC-0007 §5.3 parity plus runtime behaviour.
4. The append-on-replay bug is **seven** sites across **three** modes (Decision 2, Proposal 2, Task 3), not two.
5. The double-apply risk is **not** present on the agent path (verified: no local apply in `ParticipantActions`, no `BaseSession` in `agent/`) — unlike the TypeScript SDK, which has it on its happy path. It **is** present via `BaseSession` + `open_stream`, and that shape is taught by `docs/guides/building-orchestrators.md:126`, making it documented guidance rather than a hypothetical integration.

## Log

### Phase 0 — 2026-08-31

- Plan authored by a fresh Opus planning agent doing its own deep read; corrected three claims in the brief (see Corrections above). Repo map written here so later phases do not re-scan.
- One-way-door analysis (anomaly API shape) ran on Fable; three decisions escalated to and made by the user: base-level dedup gating transcript, TypeScript's scalar field set, ship-when-ready.
- Cross-repo coordination with the spec-repo and macp-sdk-typescript sessions throughout; no writes outside this repo.

### Phase 1 — 2026-08-31

- **Verdict:** PASS (round 1) → GAPS (re-verify, 2 documentation-only) → closed. Verifier tier:
  **Opus** both rounds — no one-way door in this phase (the API-shape one-way door was
  resolved before the drive started and is baked in as D1–D5).
- **Round 1 PASS with 6 advisory findings.** The gate proved rather than asserted its two
  key claims: built a git worktree at HEAD to establish the pre-Phase-1 baseline (666 → 672,
  exactly the six new tests, zero existing assertions touched), and mutation-proved the
  mode-check ordering by moving the dedup gate above it (exactly one test failed, so
  `test_wrong_mode_envelope_does_not_poison_seen_set` is the sole discriminator and is not
  passing for an incidental reason). All spec citations verified; RFC-MACP-0006 §3.2's
  redelivery clause confirmed present locally at `110add2` (not stale).
- **Advisory finding promoted to blocking by the orchestrator: the partial-apply wedge.**
  Recording the id and appending to `transcript` *before* the effect meant a raising
  `_apply_mode_message` left the envelope marked-seen-but-unapplied, and every retry was
  then silently swallowed — pre-Phase-1 a retry recovered. This is a regression introduced
  by this phase and a silent-failure path, which the standing bar forbids, so it was fixed
  rather than accepted. Fix: roll back `transcript` + `_seen_message_ids` on exception and
  re-raise unchanged. Logged in `ASSUMPTIONS.md` (UNCONFIRMED) with rejected alternatives.
- **Re-verify GAPS (2), both honesty items, both closed.** (1) The atomicity claim in the
  code comment — and in the `ASSUMPTIONS.md` entry — was stated unqualified but the rollback
  covers `transcript` and `_seen_message_ids` only, not `self.phase` or subclass collections.
  Unreachable today only because every subclass raises before it mutates; that invariant was
  undocumented, untested, and holds on a publicly exported ABC that Phases 3–4 will add
  logic inside. Both now scoped, with the invariant named as the reason the narrow rollback
  suffices. (2) The public docstring said nothing about exception behaviour, so a caller
  catching an exception had no documented basis for retrying — the whole user-visible point
  of the fix lived only in an internal comment. Now in the public contract.
- **Best catch of the run:** the unconditional `transcript.pop()` was justified by a comment
  about single-threadedness — the wrong hazard. The real risks to "`transcript[-1]` is what I
  appended" are a subclass appending to `transcript` before raising, or re-entrancy. Neither
  occurs today (all five subclasses and both call sites checked exhaustively), but a
  wrong-entry pop on a public ABC is corruption worse than the bug it fixes. Now an
  identity-guarded pop (`is`, not `==` — protobuf compares by value), with the false arm
  covered honestly by a subclass that appends a sentinel before raising.
- **Adversarial check imported from the TypeScript SDK session** (they found their own guard
  provably dead at one of six call sites): deleted the empty-`message_id` guard and ran the
  suite. Went red with exactly one failure, so the guard is live. Their structural risk did
  not transfer — `recordAnomaly` has six call sites, `apply_envelope` has one.
- **Files touched:** `src/macp_sdk/base_projection.py`, `tests/conftest.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_base_projection.py`, `ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, plan.
- **Checks:** `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test-all` green. **679 passed**
  (666 baseline + 13 new), coverage 87.83% (gate 85%), `base_projection.py` 100% —
  proven differentially by deselecting the new classes, not taken from the summary line.
- **Ship decision:** **accumulate**, do not ship alone. Per the plan's shipping table PR A is
  phases 0+1+2; Phase 1 alone would ship a user-visible `transcript` behaviour change with
  zero CHANGELOG narrative, and Phase 2 *is* the release narrative for the second,
  independent bug (replay inflation across seven append sites).
- **Next:** Phase 2.

### Phase 2 — 2026-08-31

- **Verdict:** GAPS (1 blocking, 4 minor) → closed → green. Verifier tier: **Opus** — tests
  and release notes only, no one-way door.
- **Tests are load-bearing, proven not assumed.** The gate neutered the Phase 1 dedup guard
  and re-ran: **8 of 8** new tests failed. So no Phase 2 test fell into the id-reuse trap
  (`make_envelope` mints a fresh uuid4 per call, so two calls would have silently turned a
  redelivery test into a distinctness test that passes while proving nothing). Tree restored
  byte-identically, verified by md5.
- **Blast radius verified by execution, not by reading the plan.** The gate ran a real
  double-apply and diffed every accessor. Changed: `evaluations` 2→4, `objections` 1→2,
  `review_evaluations()` 1→2, `qualifying_evaluations()` 1→2, `accepts`/`rejections`/
  `updates`/`completions`/`failures` 1→2, `transcript` 3→6. Unchanged:
  `has_blocking_objection()`, `is_accepted()`, `accepted_proposal()`, `is_retryable()`,
  `latest_progress()`, `progress_of()`, plus `is_terminally_rejected()`,
  `has_terminal_rejection()`, `is_completed()`, `is_failed()`, `vote_totals()`.
  **Zero false claims in the CHANGELOG body.**
- **"Seven sites" confirmed exact, not an undercount** — full `.append(` inventory re-run
  across `src/macp_sdk/`; `handoff.py` and `quorum.py` have zero.
- **G1 (blocking):** the `## Unreleased` preamble read "No SDK API changes" while the bullet
  four lines below described `apply_envelope` no-opping on redelivery — self-refuting on the
  same screen. Narrowed to "plus one projection behaviour fix — no API *signature* changes."
- **G2 — a defect in THIS PLAN, not in the executor's work.** Phase 2 criterion 1 prescribed
  `assert len(qualifying_evaluations()) == 0`, which **cannot fail**: with a single `REVIEW`
  evaluation that accessor filters `!= "REVIEW"` and returns `[]` however many times the
  envelope is applied. It read like coverage of an accessor the CHANGELOG names as affected
  while pinning nothing. Criterion corrected in the plan; the test now feeds a second
  non-`REVIEW` evaluation and asserts `== 1`. The fixer confirmed the *new* assertion is
  independently load-bearing by running the sequence standalone against a neutered guard
  (returned 2, not 1) rather than letting it ride on an earlier assertion.
- **G4:** this CHANGELOG entry is PR A's *only* user-facing artifact (Phase 1 docs are
  deliberately deferred to Phase 5), so two contract boundaries had no user-visible signal
  anywhere: empty `message_id` is never deduped, and a failed apply rolls back so the caller
  can retry. Both added, with the rollback's honest limit stated.
- **G3:** the class-docstring trap table listed a "Distinctness" row no test in that class
  exercises; now cross-references `test_base_projection.py::TestIdempotentApply::
  test_distinct_message_ids_both_applied`.
- **Files touched:** `tests/unit/test_decision_projection.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_proposal_projection.py`, `tests/unit/test_task_projection.py`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, plan. **Zero `src/` changes** — the mechanism shipped in
  Phase 1; this phase proves it and narrates it.
- **Checks:** `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test-all` green. **687 passed**
  (679 + 8), coverage 87.83% (gate 85%).
- **Ship decision:** **ship now as PR A (phases 0+1+2).** The gate confirmed nothing in PR A
  depends on B or C — no anomaly surface, no cardinality change — so the hard sequencing
  interlock is satisfied.
- **Next:** Phase 3 (inert `ProjectionAnomaly` surface).

### Phase 3 — 2026-08-31

- **Verdict:** PASS (round 1) with 4 non-blocking gaps, all closed. Verifier tier: **Opus** —
  the one-way door (the anomaly API shape) was resolved before the drive began and is fixed
  as D2, so this phase only implements a settled contract.
- **Inertness proven empirically, not argued.** The gate monkeypatched `_record_anomaly` with
  a counting spy and ran unit + conformance (745 tests): **call count 2**, both from the two
  dedicated tests, zero from production code and zero from fixture replay. It also swept
  `src/ tests/ examples/` for reflection over projections (`vars`, `__dict__`, `asdict`,
  `copy`, `pickle`, `__eq__`, `dir`) — the only hit is `test_public_api.py:17` over the
  *module*, not a projection. Adding an attribute to `__init__` is therefore unobservable.
  `projections.py` / `quorum.py` byte-identical to `070f6f5`.
- **`frozen=True, slots=True` pitfall sweep — all clean:** `asdict`, `astuple`, `replace`,
  `copy`/`deepcopy`, **pickle roundtrip**, `__eq__`, **hashable**, plain and dataclass
  subclassing. Hashability matters downstream: Phase 4 criterion 12's
  `replay.anomalies == p.anomalies` list equality depends on it.
- **Two permanent consequences of `slots=True`, recorded because the shape is now frozen:**
  `vars(anomaly)` / `anomaly.__dict__` **raises**, so naive `__dict__`-based JSON
  serialization fails on a type users will obviously want to serialize (`dataclasses.asdict`
  is the answer); and the decorator returns a *new* class object, so any future method cannot
  use zero-arg `super()`.
- **G1 — the CHANGELOG preamble went false a second time.** Phase 2 narrowed it to "no API
  *signature* changes"; Phase 3 adds three public exports. Now "additive only, no existing
  signatures changed", plus an `### Added` entry that states plainly the surface is **inert**
  (nothing produces an anomaly yet) so no reader thinks the signal is live.
- **G3 — a defect in THIS PLAN.** Phase 3 criterion 10 required
  `git grep 'warnings.warn' src/` to return *nothing*, which is unsatisfiable: four
  pre-existing hits in `task.py`, all present at `070f6f5`, unrelated deprecation shims.
  Anyone running the literal check would wrongly conclude the phase failed. Criterion
  corrected to the whole-plan form (no *new* occurrences vs the base commit).
- **G4 + a test defect the gate found.** Nothing pinned the lazy `%`-formatting the plan
  requires — an f-string conversion would have kept the WARNING-count assertion green; now
  asserted via `record.args` non-empty and `"%s" in record.msg`. Separately,
  `from __future__ import annotations` makes `__annotations__` values the *string* `"str"`,
  so an `annotation is str` arm was dead code and the test pinned annotation *spelling*
  rather than resolved types; replaced with `typing.get_type_hints()`. Field name/order
  assertions untouched — those are the cross-SDK contract.
- **Files touched:** `src/macp_sdk/base_projection.py`, `src/macp_sdk/__init__.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_base_projection.py`, `docs/api/index.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `PROGRESS.md`,
  plan.
- **Checks:** `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test-all` green. **695 unit passed**
  (687 + 8), coverage 87.92% (gate 85%), `base_projection.py` 100% with both `has_anomalies`
  arms and both `detail`-default paths covered by dedicated tests. `mkdocs build --strict`
  NOT run — mkdocs is not installed in `.venv`; the mkdocstrings identifier was verified to
  resolve by import instead.
- **Ship decision:** **ship now as PR B.** Additive, provably inert, bisectable apart from
  the semantics change, and nothing in B depends on C.
- **Next:** Phase 4 (first-wins at the two sites) — the phase the sequencing interlock exists
  to protect.

### Phase 4 — 2026-08-31

- **Delivered:** First-wins at the two D3 sites, wiring the D2 anomaly surface (Phase 3) up
  to a real producer for the first time.
  - `src/macp_sdk/projections.py` — Decision Vote branch: if `envelope.sender` already has
    an entry in `self.votes[proposal_id]`, records `ANOMALY_DUPLICATE_VOTE` and returns
    without mutating `votes` or `phase`.
  - `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py` — `_set_ballot` signature changed from
    `(request_id, sender, vote, reason)` to `(envelope, request_id, vote, reason)` (sender
    now read off the envelope); all three call sites (Approve/Reject/Abstain) updated. Being
    the single funnel is what makes this one change enforce RFC-0011 §5 rule 3's
    *across-type* cardinality (Approve→Reject→Abstain churn), not just same-type.
    `message_type` recorded on the anomaly is the DISCARDED message's type.
  - `src/macp_sdk/base_projection.py` — **docstring/comment only, zero code changes**
    (confirmed via `git diff --stat`): fixed three claims that Phase 1/3 left true-then and
    false-now — `apply_envelope`'s "Honest limitation" paragraph no longer says a genuine
    duplicate "is applied like any other envelope" (it's now discarded and recorded, cites
    the two producer sites); `_record_anomaly`'s "Inert in this phase" docstring line and
    the matching `__init__` comment both replaced with the real call sites, since this exact
    diff is what stops them being inert.
  - `detail` is facts-only, no cause attribution, exactly per plan wording:
    `"kept first vote 'approve'; discarded 'reject'"` style.
- **Tests:** `tests/unit/test_quorum_projection.py` — `test_one_sender_one_ballot` rewritten
  in place (name kept, now accurate), docstring cites RFC-MACP-0011 §5 rule 3 +
  RFC-MACP-0007 §5.3 parity + `quorum.rs:164/184/204`, states why "latest ballot supersedes"
  was wrong, ends with "do not fix this test by restoring the old assertions." New
  `TestBallotCardinality` class: the three across-type ordered pairs (Approve→Reject,
  Reject→Abstain, Abstain→Approve), the redelivery-is-a-noop test (same envelope object
  twice ⇒ zero anomalies — the single most important test per the plan), and an
  anomaly-shape + exactly-one-`caplog`-WARNING test. `tests/unit/test_decision_projection.py`
  — new `TestVoteCardinality` class: `test_one_sender_one_vote_per_proposal` (cites
  RFC-MACP-0007 §5.3 + `decision.rs:217`), a `majority_winner()`-under-duplicate-feed test,
  the redelivery-no-anomaly test, an anomaly-shape/caplog test, and
  `test_replay_of_transcript_reproduces_votes_and_anomalies` — feeds one conforming vote +
  one redelivery of that same envelope + one genuine duplicate, replays `transcript` through
  a fresh projection, asserts `replay.votes == p.votes`, `replay.phase == p.phase`, **and**
  `replay.anomalies == p.anomalies` by content equality (criterion 12; guards the real
  invariant that anomalies must be reconstructible from `transcript` alone — mutation
  testing disproved the earlier claim that this also catches the dedup guard moving after
  the transcript append; that mutation is caught by ten other transcript-length tests
  instead). `tests/unit/test_agent_strategies.py` — new
  `TestMajorityStrategiesUnderFirstWins`, feeding a real `DecisionProjection` (not a
  `MagicMock`) through `majority_voter()`/`majority_committer()` with a discarded vote
  change, confirming both strategies see the first-wins tally (0 approvals, no winner) and
  would have flipped to a false majority under the old last-wins behaviour.
  `tests/conformance/test_conformance_projections.py` — `assert not projection.has_anomalies`
  added immediately after the accepted-message replay loop (line 164, matching the plan's
  citation exactly), before the existing `transcript` length assertion.
- **Criterion-8 regression check:** ran the seven named pre-existing tests
  (`test_approve_and_threshold`, `test_reject_and_abstain`, `test_threshold_unreachable`,
  `test_commitment_ready_false_after_commit`, `test_vote_and_totals`,
  `test_abstain_excluded_from_majority`, `test_review_evaluations`) in isolation and via
  `git diff` — all seven pass unmodified; only `test_one_sender_one_ballot` in that file was
  touched, exactly as scoped.
- **Checks:** `make lint`, `make typecheck` clean. `make test-all` green: unit **707 passed**
  (695 baseline + 12 new), coverage 87.97% (gate 85%, `base_projection.py` 100%); integration
  33 skipped (no live runtime, expected); conformance **50 passed, 2 skipped** (pre-existing
  multi_round skips) with the new zero-anomaly assertion holding across the whole corpus;
  `lint-fixtures` clean (17/17 fixtures internally consistent). `git grep -c 'warnings.warn'
  src/` still 4, all pre-existing in `task.py`, zero new occurrences.
- **Files touched:** `src/macp_sdk/projections.py`, `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py`,
  `src/macp_sdk/base_projection.py` (docstrings/comments only),
  `tests/unit/test_quorum_projection.py`, `tests/unit/test_decision_projection.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_agent_strategies.py`, `tests/conformance/test_conformance_projections.py`,
  `PROGRESS.md`. No CHANGELOG or `docs/modes/` edits — those are Phase 5 per the plan.
- **Ship decision:** **accumulate.** This is PR C in the plan's shipping table and is the
  phase the hard sequencing interlock exists to protect — Phase 5 (documented-behaviour
  removal, CHANGELOG entries) is this phase's release narrative and ships alongside it, not
  separately.
- **Next:** Phase 5 (documented-behaviour removal and release notes).

### Phase 5 — 2026-08-31

- **Delivered:** the documented-behaviour removal (`## Ballot override` →
  `## First ballot stands`) and the release narrative. Docs-only; zero `src/` changes.
- **Both brief claims about `## Ballot override` verified true before rewriting, as
  required:** (1) its `session.reject("r1", sender="alice")` → `session.approve("r1",
  sender="alice")` example is NACKed by a conforming runtime (`quorum.rs:164/184/204`,
  `INVALID_ENVELOPE`) before the second call ever reaches `_send_and_track`'s local apply —
  confirmed by reading `base_session.py:79-88`, which only calls
  `self.projection.apply_envelope(envelope)` when `ack.ok`; on a NACK it just logs and
  returns, so the projection is never touched. (2) its code sample's shape does not match
  the real API: `proj.ballots["alice"].choice` assumes a flat `dict[sender, BallotRecord]`
  with a `.choice` field; the real shape is `dict[request_id, dict[sender, BallotRecord]]`
  (`quorum.py:55`) with field `.vote` (`quorum.py:31`), confirmed by reading the source.
- **`docs/modes/quorum.md`** — rewrote the projection-queries block (`:105-131` original)
  fixing every identifier against `quorum.py`: `proj.request` → `proj.requests.get(request_id)`;
  all six count/threshold helpers now take `request_id`; added the three previously-undocumented
  query methods (`threshold`, `voted_senders`, `remaining_votes_needed`) since acceptance
  criterion 2 named them explicitly; added `proj.anomalies` / `proj.has_anomalies` (criterion 3).
  Replaced `## Ballot override` with `## First ballot stands`: states the RFC-0011 §5 cap
  citation is for cardinality only (§5's MUST-enforce preamble), states RFC-0011 is silent on
  which-of-two-stands, attributes first-wins to RFC-0007 §5.3 parity + runtime behaviour
  (not an RFC-0011 citation), demonstrates the discard via direct `apply_envelope` calls
  (not `session.approve()`, since that path never reaches the projection against a
  conforming runtime — see verification above), and states plainly there is no vote-changing
  mechanism and the SDK will not invent one (Retract/Supersede is spec-level).
  **Flagged as out-of-scope when this phase first landed, then found and fixed in a
  follow-up pass before shipping — not deferred.** The `## Session helper` (`:56-101`
  original) and `## Orchestrator patterns` (`:145-180` original) code blocks in this same file
  called `proj.has_quorum()`, `proj.approval_count()`, `proj.is_threshold_unreachable(5)`,
  `proj.commitment_ready(total_eligible=5)` with no `request_id`, and the "Weighted quorum"
  block read `ballot.choice` off a flat `proj.ballots.items()` instead of `.vote` off the
  nested `dict[request_id, dict[sender, BallotRecord]]` (`quorum.py:55`). Re-verifying against
  `quorum.py` while fixing these also turned up two more instances of the same drift class
  that the original flag missed: `## Key semantics` (`:44` original) still said "later ballots
  override earlier ones," contradicting the "First ballot stands" section a few lines below in
  the same file; and `## Authorization & termination` (`:53` original) told readers to call
  `proj.commitment_ready(total_eligible)`, a signature that has never existed —
  `commitment_ready` takes only `request_id` (`quorum.py:156`) and folds in the
  already-committed check, it does not do the mathematically-unreachable half at all (that's
  `is_threshold_unreachable(request_id, total_eligible)`, a separate call). All five spots
  fixed in place; every identifier and arity re-checked against `quorum.py` directly rather
  than trusting the earlier flag's list. Rationale for fixing now rather than filing a
  follow-up issue as originally planned: a doc file that was just certified correct in one
  section while known-broken samples remain two sections down is worse than either leaving
  the whole file uncorrected (which at least doesn't carry the false signal of "this page was
  just verified") or fixing it completely — a half-corrected file invites a reader to trust
  the parts that were never re-checked.
- **`docs/modes/decision.md`** — `:108` `has_blocking_objection` claim corrected from
  `{high, critical, block}` to `critical`-only, verified against `projections.py:165-174`
  (`any(objection.severity.lower() == "critical" ...)`) and `test_critical_only_veto`.
  `:120` `transcript` description corrected from "full ordered history" to "accepted history
  as fed, deduplicated by `message_id`". Confirmed no "latest wins" claim exists anywhere in
  this file (grep-verified) — nothing else touched, per the brief's explicit instruction not
  to add an unrelated correction here.
- **`docs/guides/building-orchestrators.md`** — added a warning block after the Event-driven
  orchestrator snippet (`:117-134` original) covering all four required elements: the
  double-apply mechanics (`session.projection` fed by both `_send_and_track` and the stream
  loop), "safe as of this release" (idempotent on `message_id`), the "works, which is why
  it's dangerous" framing (the example's `break`-before-second-apply narrowly escapes, which
  is exactly what makes it a template someone extends unsafely), and a pointer to
  `proj.anomalies` for genuine duplicates. Added the projection-topology statement (criterion
  11) in the same block: Python's `Participant` never constructs a `BaseSession` (separate
  projection instances), explicitly stated as differing from the TypeScript SDK's deliberate
  sharing.
- **`docs/architecture.md:131`** — added a short paragraph after the "Projection lifecycle"
  list cross-referencing the building-orchestrators warning by anchor
  (`guides/building-orchestrators.md#pattern-event-driven-orchestrator`), matching this repo's
  existing cross-reference convention (verified other `../architecture.md#anchor` /
  `guides/*.md` links in `docs/protocol.md`, `docs/guides/agent-framework.md`).
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — added `### Changed` between `### Added` and `### Fixed` (matching this
  file's own established heading order, e.g. the `0.5.0` section). Contains, in substance: the
  first-accepted-stands rule, "changing your vote by re-sending it no longer works" in the
  caller's own words, the Retract/Supersede spec-level framing, motivation framed as
  runtime-alignment (explicitly not "the RFC was tightened" — checked against spec commit
  `f1489df`'s own "needs no code change anywhere" framing), the `required_approvals=1`
  concrete stake (same accepted history, different terminal outcome), and the anomaly
  signal's narrow observation-not-verdict claim. Verified by grep (see below) that the
  `### Fixed` (replay-inflation) entry remains independently findable by a reader grepping
  `replay`/`duplicate` while excluding lines containing `vote` — line 67 ("Projections no
  longer inflate their lists on replay (issue #43)") matches. Narrowed the `## Unreleased`
  preamble a third time: dropped "additive only, no existing signatures changed" (false now —
  two methods return different results for the same input) for language naming the breaking
  change directly.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — added one line under `base_projection.py` mentioning `message_id`
  idempotency and `ProjectionAnomaly`, per the brief. **Not a deliverable**: `CLAUDE.md` is
  gitignored (`.gitignore:210`), confirmed by reading the file; this edit is local-only and
  will not appear in the PR diff.
- **Criterion-1 grep, run exactly as specified:**
  `git grep -in 'latest wins\|latest ballot\|ballot override\|supersedes the previous' docs/`
  → zero hits. `docs/modes/proposal.md`'s four `supersedes` hits (`:35/:44/:103/:123`, the
  correct CounterProposal feature) untouched — confirmed still present, matching neither
  banned phrase (the grep pattern requires "supersedes the previous", not the bare word).
- **Checks:** `make lint` (ruff check + format --check) clean. `make typecheck` (mypy strict)
  clean. `make test-all` green: unit **707 passed** (identical to the Phase 4 baseline — zero
  `src/`/`tests/` changes this phase), coverage **87.97%** (gate 85%), conformance 50 passed /
  2 skipped, `lint-fixtures` 17/17 clean. `tests/unit/test_examples_smoke.py` unaffected
  (still 9/9 example-compile tests passing, untouched). `mkdocs build --strict` NOT run —
  mkdocs not installed in `.venv` (consistent with Phase 3's note); not a CI gate today per
  criterion 8's own wording.
- **Ship decision:** **ship now as PR C (phases 4 + 5), per the plan's shipping table.** This
  closes the plan: A (0+1+2) already shipped, B (3) already shipped, C (4+5) is now complete
  and gated by the same interlock (Phase 4's redelivery tests) that was verified green in the
  Phase 4 log.
- **Next:** none — plan complete. The `docs/modes/quorum.md` drift flagged above as
  out-of-scope was found and fixed in a follow-up pass before PR C shipped (see below);
  nothing remains deferred.

### Phase 5 follow-up — 2026-08-31

Four items closed before PR C shipped, none touching `src/`:

1. `tests/unit/test_decision_projection.py::test_replay_of_transcript_reproduces_votes_and_anomalies`
   — removed the docstring's uniqueness claim ("no other test in the suite does"). Uniqueness
   is a property of one suite at one moment, falsified by the next added test including one
   that improves the codebase; measured evidence showed the claimed mutation produced 1
   failure in this suite and 4 in the TypeScript SDK's, i.e. non-transferable. Kept the actual
   invariant (anomalies reconstructible from `transcript` alone) and added the normative
   anchor RFC-MACP-0006 §3.2 point 3 (the consumer-side idempotency clause), distinct from
   the obligation-4 citation already correct in `base_projection.py`. No assertions changed.
2. `tests/conformance/test_conformance_projections.py:164`'s zero-anomaly gate is now
   two-channel: alongside `not projection.has_anomalies`, replay now runs inside
   `caplog.at_level(logging.WARNING, logger="macp_sdk")` and asserts no `projection anomaly`
   WARNING was logged, following `tests/unit/test_base_projection.py`'s logging-assertion
   style. The anomalies list is contractual; the warn log was declared non-contractual in the
   cross-SDK agreement, so a future change could legitimately drop the warn while keeping the
   list — a single-channel gate would then silently stop covering half of what it was written
   for. Reasoning commented at the assertion.
3. Same gate's failure messages now name `schemas/conformance/` in the spec repo explicitly,
   since a failure here can mean a canonical fixture changed upstream rather than an SDK
   regression — the message now points a reader's debugging path out of this repo instead of
   ending at "the test is fussy."
4. `docs/modes/quorum.md` — finished the correction Phase 5 started rather than leaving it
   half-done (see the amended Phase 5 log entry above for the full list: `## Session helper`,
   `## Orchestrator patterns` incl. Weighted quorum, plus two more instances of the same drift
   class found while re-verifying — `## Key semantics`'s "later ballots override" line and
   `## Authorization & termination`'s nonexistent `commitment_ready(total_eligible)` call).
   Every identifier and arity re-checked directly against `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py`.

Re-ran the criterion-1 grep from Phase 5 as instructed:
`git grep -in 'latest wins\|latest ballot\|ballot override\|supersedes the previous' docs/`
→ zero hits, `docs/modes/proposal.md`'s legitimate `supersedes` hits still present.
`make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test-all` all green; unit suite still 707 passed,
coverage 87.97% (no test count change — item 2 added assertions inside the existing
parametrized test, not a new test).

### Final verification gate — 2026-08-31

A verification pass ahead of shipping PR C found five more findings, closed here.
Worth remembering: one of them (GAP 1) was not old drift — it was a **false normative
claim introduced by the Phase 5 fix itself**. The Phase 5 rewrite of
`docs/modes/quorum.md`'s "Projection queries" intro replaced accurate-but-vague text
with a new sentence ("Quorum mode supports multiple concurrent approval requests
within one session") that is flatly wrong: RFC-MACP-0011 §5 rule 1 caps a session at
one `ApprovalRequest`, the runtime holds `state.request` as a single `Option`, and the
*same file* says so twice more (`## Key semantics` and the error-cases table). A fix
for one accuracy gap silently created another, in the same file, contradicting text
left untouched three lines away. Lesson: an accuracy-motivated rewrite needs the same
verify-against-source discipline as the drift it's replacing — "sounds more precise"
is not the same as "checked against the RFC" — and a file-local self-consistency pass
(does the fixed paragraph agree with the rest of the same page?) is worth doing even
when the paragraph is a small, no-code documentation edit.

Gaps closed, no `src/` changes:

1. **[BLOCKING] `docs/modes/quorum.md:106-108` false claim** (above) — replaced with the
   true rationale: `requests`/`ballots` are keyed by `request_id` (`quorum.py:54-55`),
   an implementation shape the accessors mirror; cited RFC-MACP-0011 §5 rule 1 for the
   one-request-per-session cap instead of denying it. `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py:44`'s
   docstring carries the same overclaim — pre-existing, out of scope, not touched; filing
   for a follow-up.
2. **[BLOCKING] `CHANGELOG.md` `### Added` self-contradiction** — rewrote the
   `ProjectionAnomaly` entry from "currently inert, follow-up producer" (false as of
   `4a29087`: `_record_anomaly` has two callers, `projections.py:112` and
   `quorum.py:105`) to "wired in this release," cross-referencing `### Changed` for the
   producer.
3. **Missing retraction** — added the mandated "if you followed this pattern before
   this release, your projection may have been double-applying" warning, naming the
   inflated-counts/`len(transcript)` symptom, to both `docs/guides/building-orchestrators.md`
   (addressed to a reader who copied the streaming-loop snippet) and `CHANGELOG.md`'s
   `### Fixed` entry (naming the guide's pattern as a second trigger alongside the
   `Participant`/supervisor `run()` reconnect one, which was previously the only one
   named).
4. **`examples/quorum_approval.py` `TypeError`** — four calls
   (`approval_count`/`rejection_count`/`has_quorum`, twice) used the pre-`request_id`
   arity. Re-verified every identifier and arity in the file against
   `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py`; only those four were stale. Fixed by threading a
   `request_id = "r1"` variable through, matching the pattern already used in
   `docs/modes/quorum.md`. Verified by extracting the same projection calls into a
   standalone script against a hand-built envelope sequence — no `TypeError`, correct
   counts (3 approvals, 1 rejection, `has_quorum` True).
5. **[minor] `CHANGELOG.md:7` undercount** — "two projection methods" → "two projection
   code paths" (at least ten methods plus two attributes actually changed behavior).
   Also fixed comment-column misalignment in `docs/modes/quorum.md`'s "Ballots" and
   "Counts" blocks (three lines whose `#` landed one-to-two columns off their block's
   established column).

**Checks:** `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test-all` all green; unit suite
**707 passed** (no test count change — doc/example-only), coverage **87.97%** (gate
85%). Re-ran the criterion-1-style grep for the retraction language:
`grep -rn 'if you followed\|before this release\|inflated' docs/ CHANGELOG.md` → hits
only in the two newly-added blocks, confirming both required locations now carry it.

### Phase 5 — 2026-08-31 (final)

- **Verdict:** GAPS → GAPS → GAPS → **PASS on round 4.** Verifier tier: **Opus** every round.
  Docs-only phase, no one-way door.
- **The defining pattern of this phase, worth remembering:** `docs/modes/quorum.md` was
  rewritten four times for accuracy, and **each of the first three passes introduced a NEW
  false statement while fixing the previous one.** An accuracy-motivated rewrite is not safer
  than the drift it replaces — it is a fresh opportunity to assert something wrong, made worse
  by reading as authoritative *because* it was just reviewed. Round 4 broke the streak only
  because the brief said so explicitly and required an end-to-end sweep rather than a
  diff-scoped one.
- **Round 1 GAPS (4+1).** Two blockers were self-contradictions inside the artifacts this
  phase exists to make trustworthy: the rewritten block asserted "Quorum mode supports multiple
  concurrent approval requests within one session" — false per RFC-MACP-0011 §5 rule 1, the
  runtime, and *the same file* at two other lines — and `CHANGELOG.md`'s `### Added` still
  called the anomaly surface "inert" with its producer "a follow-up", false as of Phase 4 in
  the same release and refuted 40 lines below. Also: the mandated retraction was missing from
  both required locations, and a shipped example called pre-`request_id` arities.
- **Round 2 GAPS (2 substantive).** The GAP 1 fix was only applied to hand-written prose:
  `quorum.md` renders `::: macp_sdk.quorum.QuorumProjection` via mkdocstrings, and
  `quorum.py`'s class docstring still carried the identical false claim — so **the built page
  asserted and denied it 130 lines apart.** The orchestrator's own "zero `src/` changes" rule
  was the direct cause; it was lifted for a docstring-only edit. Round 2 also found new prose
  offering "a new `request_id`, or a new session" as alternatives, when rule 1 makes the first
  require the second.
- **A correction to a prior gate's evidence.** Round 1 reported `examples/quorum_approval.py`
  "proven to raise `TypeError`". Round 2 ran the *example* rather than the methods and found
  it raises `MacpIdentityMismatchError` first (`:34`, session built as `coordinator`, sends as
  `alice`) — pre-existing at `4a29087`, so execution never reaches the arity bug. Execution-
  based proof is only as good as what was actually executed.
- **Round 4 PASS.** Every normative statement and code sample in the 246-line file verified
  against `quorum.py`, RFC-0011, RFC-0007, RFC-0012 and the runtime; whole `## Unreleased`
  CHANGELOG read as one document; `git diff 4a29087 -- src/` confirmed one hunk, -3/+5, the
  class docstring only, **zero executable lines**; collected node-id set byte-identical to
  `4a29087` (759 ids incl. parametrisations).
- **Files touched:** `docs/modes/quorum.md`, `docs/modes/decision.md`,
  `docs/guides/building-orchestrators.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `examples/quorum_approval.py`, `src/macp_sdk/quorum.py` (docstring only), `PROGRESS.md`,
  plan. `CLAUDE.md` updated locally but is gitignored (`.gitignore:210`) — **not a deliverable
  and absent from the PR.**
- **Checks:** `make lint`, `make typecheck`, `make test-all` green. 707 passed, 87.97%
  (gate 85%), conformance 50/2, fixture lint 17/17.
- **Interrupted mid-phase by the machine running out of disk space.** Every writing tool
  failed with `ENOSPC`, including Bash (it cannot write its own output log). The blocked agent
  failed atomically and left the tree untouched — no partial writes, nothing lost. Resumed
  after the user freed space; HEAD, all modified files and the 707-test suite were intact.
- **Ship decision:** ship as PR C (phases 4+5).
- **Filed as follow-up, all PRE-EXISTING and present on main:** (1) `examples/quorum_approval.py`
  is advertised as runnable but raises on an auth/sender mismatch, with the same latent defect
  in `quorum.md`'s snippet; (2) `quorum.md:46` claims a fractional threshold raises
  `MacpSessionError` — `build_quorum_policy` only raises on `< 0` or `> 100`, so `0.75` passes
  through silently and only mypy catches it; (3) `quorum.md:88`'s `total_eligible = 5  # all
  participants except coordinator` contradicts RFC-0011 §2.1 — a listed coordinator IS an
  eligible ballot caster, so it is 6; (4) the conformance corpus has zero fixtures for
  `Objection`, `Withdraw`, `TaskUpdate` (spec repo issue #81), so `has_blocking_objection`
  has no cross-implementation oracle.

- pushed docs/pin-raise-before-mutate-invariant 123e922 (2026-09-06) — /reconcile follow-ups: raise-before-mutate contract on the abstract docstring + tests/unit/test_projection_rollback_invariant.py. Docs+tests only, no behaviour change. Ship verification: Opus, 2 rounds (round 1 GAPS x3, round 2 PASS).
