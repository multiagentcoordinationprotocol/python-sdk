"""Integration tests for RFC-MACP-0006-A1 session subscription + replay.

A non-initiator agent that opens its ``StreamSession`` *after* the
initiator has already sent ``SessionStart`` and ``Proposal`` must still
see both envelopes, because the runtime replays accepted history
following a subscribe frame and then switches to live broadcast.

Requires a running MACP runtime on localhost:50051 with:
  MACP_ALLOW_INSECURE=1
  MACP_ALLOW_DEV_SENDER_HEADER=1
