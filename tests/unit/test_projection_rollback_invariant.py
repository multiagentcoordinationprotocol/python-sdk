"""Pins the raise-before-mutate invariant every ``_apply_mode_message`` owes.

``BaseProjection.apply_envelope``'s rollback restores ``transcript`` and the
``message_id`` dedup set only — it cannot restore subclass state, because the
base class has no way to know what a subclass mutated. That narrow rollback is
*sufficient* only because every concrete projection does its one fallible
operation (``ParseFromString``) strictly before any mutation. Break that
ordering and the projection half-applies while ``apply_envelope`` reports a
clean rollback and invites a retry.

Until this module existed, that invariant lived only in a code comment in
``base_projection.py`` — asserted in prose, pinned by nothing. It was
re-verified by hand when the first-wins/anomaly logic landed (PR #47/#48 added
code *inside* these very methods), which is exactly the kind of check that
should not depend on someone remembering to do it.

The test feeds each mode branch a payload that cannot parse and asserts the
projection's **entire** observable state is byte-for-byte what it was before
the call. That covers both halves at once: the base rollback (transcript,
dedup set) and the subclass invariant (no collection touched, ``phase``
unmoved). A branch that mutated before parsing fails here.
