# Contributing

Internal notes for maintainers of `macp-sdk-python`. End-user docs live under `docs/`.

## Local setup

```bash
make setup            # pip install -e ".[dev,docs]"
```

Runs the full dev toolchain: `ruff`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `build`, and the mkdocs site.

## Green-bar gates

Every PR must pass:

```bash
ruff check src/ tests/
ruff format --check src/ tests/
mypy src/macp_sdk/
pytest tests/unit tests/conformance -q
```

Integration and runtime smoke tests require a running MACP runtime — see `CLAUDE.md`.

## Bumping `macp-proto`

The SDK pins `macp-proto` with a **tight upper bound** (currently `<0.2.0`). This is intentional: proto changes can silently break envelope serialization, projection parsing, or RPC signatures, and we want every new minor to pass the conformance suite before users see it.

To move the pin:

1. Check the `macp-proto` release notes for the target version.
2. Install the new version in a dev venv: `pip install 'macp-proto==X.Y.Z'`.
3. Run the full test matrix, including integration and conformance:
   ```bash
   make test-all
   make test-conformance
   make test-integration   # against a matching-version runtime
   ```
4. If anything breaks, fix the SDK (or report the proto regression upstream).
5. Once green, update the pin in `pyproject.toml` (`macp-proto>=…,<…`) and this doc.
6. Note the upgrade in `CHANGELOG.md`.

The CI job `proto-drift` (see `.github/workflows/proto-drift.yml`, Q-16) runs the conformance suite against `macp-proto>=0.1.0` resolved from PyPI daily and opens an issue if it breaks — don't wait for that to notice a problem, but treat its failure as an action item.

## Release process

1. Bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` (and the `client_version` default in `src/macp_sdk/client.py` if it's a minor).
2. Append a dated entry to `CHANGELOG.md` describing the change.
3. `git commit` the bump + changelog on `main`.
4. `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `git push --tags`.
5. The `publish.yml` workflow runs the full test matrix, builds, and uploads to PyPI via trusted publishing.
6. PyPI publishes are immutable — double-check the tag before pushing.

## Testing against an unreleased proto

```bash
make dev-link-protos   # installs ../multiagentcoordinationprotocol/packages/proto-python in editable mode
```

This is a pre-release workflow only; releases must pin a published `macp-proto` version.
